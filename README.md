Very simple brain computer interface, with the loosest possible definition of the term. But I made this for <$35, so yeah. 
The schematics are for the preamplifiers that will get your signal to the levels required to be read by a sound card.
If your computer's sound card doesn't take this input because of its internal filters, you can use the arduino code to send output messages to serial port, which you can connect to any phone with OTG, and use the phone's screen as the display interface.
